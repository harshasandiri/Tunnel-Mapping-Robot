The goal is to develop a self-navigating robot that can map tunnels by wirelessly transmitting data.
路 A prototype was developed and the robot can avoid obstacles effectively.
路 A customized Fuzzy Logic Algorithm was developed for the robot. Developed using embedded C in an
Eclipse environment.
路 The robot is controlled via a 32-bit Dual-core Microcontroller.
路 The next step is to enable the robot to transmit its sensor data wirelessly using a lightweight protocol.
(MQTT)
A mapping algorithm is yet to be developed.
