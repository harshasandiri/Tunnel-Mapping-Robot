Tunnel Mapping Robot
====================

*The goal is to develop a self-navigating robot that can map tunnels by wirelessly transmitting data.*

- A prototype was developed and the robot can avoid obstacles effectively.

- A customized **Fuzzy Logic Algorithm** was developed for the robot. Developed using embedded C in an Eclipse environment.

- Controlled via a 32-bit Dual-core Microcontroller.(ESP32)

- *The next step is to enable the robot to transmit its sensor data wirelessly using a lightweight protocol.(MQTT) (WIP)*

- *A mapping algorithm is yet to be developed. (WIP)*
